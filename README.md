# Soil_moisture_intercomparison_EU

This repository comprises the coding used to evaluate the intercomparability of three global-scale remote-sensing and model-based soil moisture products over the European Union and the Mediterranean Basin adopted for the associated manuscript "Soil moisture products consistency for operational drought monitoring in Europe" by Jaime Gaona, Davide Bavera, Guido Fioravanti, Sebastian Hahn, Pietro Stradiotti, Paolo Filippucci, Stefania Camici, Luca Ciabatta, Hamidreza Mosaffa, Silvia Puca, Nicoletta Roberto and Luca Brocca submitted to Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Journal.

The coding include the following soil moisture datasets re-gridded at the scale of spatial analysis of 5 km x 5 km of different types:

Remote sensing origin:

1. a) ASCAT-SSM-ICDRâ€“12.5km-v7 (H120) and b) -v8 (H121)
(https://hsaf.meteoam.it/Products/Detail?prod=H120)

2. ESA CCI passive dataset (CCIp) is the subset of ESA CCI SM v08.1 (Dorigo et al., 2017; Gruber et al., 2019) (https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/soil-moisture/)

Model-based origin:

3. European Drought Observatory (https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu)   model-based SM estimates generated using the model LISFLOOD, a distributed rainfall-runoff model initially developed for flood forecasting by the Land Management and Natural Hazards Unit of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. (https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu)

Observations:

4. The International Soil Moisture Network soil moisture data comprises the European database subset that compiles soil moisture observations from the multiple networks and stations observing this key climate variable. k (https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/, Dorigo et al., 2021)
